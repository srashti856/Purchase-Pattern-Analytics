# Purchase Pattern Analytics

### Market Basket Analysis using Apriori Algorithm

## 📌 Project Overview

This project delivers an **end-to-end retail analytics solution** focused on understanding customer purchase behavior using transactional data.
By applying **Market Basket Analysis (MBA)** with the **Apriori Algorithm**, the project uncovers frequent product combinations and strong association rules that support **combo offer optimization, cross-selling strategies, and revenue improvement**.

The analysis follows a structured analytics lifecycle covering **data cleaning, validation, exploratory analysis, outlier handling, transaction transformation, and association rule mining**, supported by clear visual insights.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Retail businesses often struggle to identify:

* Which products are truly purchased together
* Reliable bundle opportunities beyond intuition
* Data-backed cross-selling strategies

Without analytical validation, combo offers and promotions may fail to deliver expected results.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Analyze customer buying behavior using transactional data
* Identify frequently co-purchased product combinations
* Generate strong association rules using **support, confidence, and lift**
* Enable data-driven combo offers and cross-selling strategies
* Present insights through dashboards and visualizations

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

* **MySQL** – Data ingestion, validation, EDA, transaction transformation
* **Advanced Excel** – Missing value checks, duplicate validation, invoice-level outlier analysis
* **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** – Apriori algorithm, association rules, visual analysis
* **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards and business-level insights

---

## 📊 Dataset Description

Transactional retail dataset containing:

* Transaction ID (BillNo)
* Product Name
* Quantity
* Price
* Customer ID
* Country
* Transaction Date

⚠️ *Note: Original dataset is not shared due to confidentiality. Structure and analysis logic are demonstrated.*

---

## 🔄 Data Preparation Workflow

1. Data ingestion and validation in MySQL
2. Data quality checks and outlier detection using Excel
3. Transaction-level basket creation (Invoice–Item format)
4. Binary matrix transformation for MBA
5. Export of clean, MBA-ready dataset for Python analysis

---

## 🧪 Methodology – Apriori Algorithm

* Generated **frequent itemsets** to identify commonly purchased products
* Applied **support threshold** to filter meaningful combinations
* Evaluated rules using **confidence and lift metrics**
* Retained only **strong, actionable association rules** for business relevance

---

## 📈 Key Results

* **84 strong association rules** identified
* **Average Lift:** 10.67× (strong positive product relationships)
* **Average Confidence:** 84.16% (high reliability of predictions)
* Identified **Top 5 frequently bought-together product combinations**
* Cross-category associations revealed gift-oriented and utility-based buying behavior

---

## 💡 Business Insights

* Certain product combinations are **10× more likely** to be purchased together
* High-confidence rules indicate **predictable and repeatable customer behavior**
* Utility and seasonal products act as **anchor items** in bundles
* Balanced support distribution shows multiple viable combo opportunities

---

## 🚀 Business Recommendations

* Launch **data-driven combo offers** using high-lift product pairs
* Implement **“Frequently Bought Together”** recommendations at checkout
* Optimize **shelf placement / website layout** for associated products
* Improve **inventory planning** for frequently co-purchased items
* Run **targeted promotions** around strong association rules
* Improved cross-selling strategies
* Increased average basket value

---

## 📊 Dashboards & Visualizations

* Sales & Purchase Pattern Insights Dashboard
* Sales Performance Overview (with & without outliers)
* Apriori-based visualizations:

  * Top product combinations
  * Support distribution
  * Lift vs Confidence analysis

All visuals are directly derived from analytical outputs to ensure **interpretability and business usability**.
